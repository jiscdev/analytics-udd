## Description of student_on_course_instance entity
A student_on_course_instance describes a student's engagement with a specific stage of a course.

## Notes
This entity has some similarities to a HESA Instance element, but deals with only a single academic year or stage without reference to the whole course, which is covered in student_course_membership.  It is similar to a HEDIIP Data Language Student Course Session entity.

### Format
String (255)

### Compulsory
Yes (if applicable)

### Notes
Mapping based on HESA codeset, and ILE (FE) initial mapping suggested above on ILR field 'PlanLearnHours'. HESA 2015 'mode' does not have code 98, but HESA 2016 'mode' does.
Omitting this property may hinder the development or use of an effective analytics model.

## FTE
### Description
This property holds the student FTE, representing the provider's best academic judgement of the full-time equivalence of the student during the period of this course_instance.

### Purpose
To describe the student's study load as a proportion of the load of a full-time student studying a full year of a full-time course. Full-time, full year students would normally be recorded as 100 and part-time students recorded as a proportion of an equivalent full-time course.

### Derivation
HESA: https://www.hesa.ac.uk/collection/c18051/a/stuload

### Valid values
0-300
The value can be recorded to one decimal place.

### Format
Decimal

### Notes
See also HESA's notes on calculating fte values: https://www.hesa.ac.uk/collection/c18051/fte.

The provider should record the HESA STULOAD value in FTE, if available. If STULOAD is not available, then providers should use their best calculation, so that FTE contains a reasonable approximation of full-time equivalence for the student.

## YEAR_PRG
### Description
This field indicates the year number of the course that the student is currently studying. This could be different from the year of student if the student has changed course or re-taken a year.

### Purpose
For analytics

### Derivation
https://www.hesa.ac.uk/collection/c18051/a/yearprg

### Valid Values
0-25

### Format
Int

### Notes
"0" indicates a foundation year or other bridging year aimed at students who are not quite ready to enter the first year of the course.

## YEAR_STU
### Description

### Format
Float

### Notes
This data is generated internally to the learning record warehouse from existing data, and does not need to be supplied by an institution.


## PROGRESSION
### Description
This property indicates the status of the student on the current course_instance.  It is mapped to common UDD values from source data that may be stored in progression_source.

### Purpose
Enables tracking of the student's continuation or otherwise from one stage of a course to another.
